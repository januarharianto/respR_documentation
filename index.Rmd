# Introduction

The `respR` package provides a structural, reproducible workflow for the processing and analysis of respirometry data. While the focus of our package is on aquatic respirometry, `respR` is largely unitless, and so can process linear relationships in any time-series data. 

Most importantly, `respR` uses peer-reviewed methods for all of its analyses, which means that all methods are well grounded in the literature. View our acknowledgements section to view a list of methods and their references.

Use `respR` to:

- automatically import raw data from various oxygen sensing equipment;
- rapidly test data for issues before analysis;
- explore and visualise timeseries data;
- calculate linear segments of data manually or automatically;
- convert units of oxygen consumption; and
- export results quickly for reporting.

 

The goal of this guide is to walk you through the `respR` package to import, analyse and convert your data. Before we begin, you will need to [install the package][installation].
