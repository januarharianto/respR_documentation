# Introduction

The R package `respR` provides a structural, reproducible workflow for the processing and analysis of respirometry data. Although the focus of the package is on aquatic respirometry, `respR` is largely unitless, and so can process linear relationships in any time-series data. All analytical methods used are peer-reviewed and rigorously tested.

Use `respR` to:

- automatically import raw data from various oxygen sensing equipment;
- rapidly test data for issues before analysis;
- explore and visualise timeseries data;
- calculate linear segments of data manually or automatically;
- convert units of oxygen consumption; and
- export results quickly for reporting.

 

The goal of this guide is to walk you through the `respR` package to import, analyse and convert your data. Before we begin, you will need to [install the package][installation].
